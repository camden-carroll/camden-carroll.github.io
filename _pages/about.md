About Me
=====
I have been passionate about engineering for as long as I can remember. The ability to use sound methods and child-like creativity is one of mankind's greatest gifts. To some degree, I have always been involved with engineering. I did a robotics program known as BEST Robotics (Boosting Engineering, Science, and Technology) throughout middle school and high school. That passion carried over into college as I studied mechanical engineering at LeTourneau University, and then completed my Master's at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I was always using my engineering creativity outside the classroom as well, making personal projects and solving simple problems around the house. As I progressed in my studies I looked for more specific classes I could take such as Applied Aerodynamics and Design of Experiments. Among others, these kinds of classes depend on my appreciation for the craft. I now look forward to taking that passion and creativity to the next stage of life!
