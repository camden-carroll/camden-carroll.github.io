Love of the Game (About Me)
=====
For as along as I can remember, I have been passionate about engineering. The abilty to use sound methods, along with child like creativity is one of mankind's greatest gifts. To some degree, I have always been involved with enigneering. All through middle school and highschool I did a robotics program known as BEST Robotics (Boosting Engineering, Science, and Technology). That passion carried over into college as I studied mechanical engineering at LeTourneau Universty. I was alwys using my engineering creativity outside the classroom as well, making personal projects and solving simple problems around the house whenever home. As I progressed in my studies I looked for more specific classes I could take such as Applied Aerodynamics and Design of Expirements. Among others, these kinds of classes depend my appreciation for the craft. I now look forward to taking that passion and creativity to industry and begin working!
