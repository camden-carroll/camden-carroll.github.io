COURSEWORK AND PROJECTS
=====
### Ammonia Detection System
* Interacted with customer and leadership to understand, design, prototype and evaluate a cost-effective ammonia detection system
* Enhanced detection sensitivity by 150% through laser reflection and modeled assemblies and parts in SOLIDWORKS
* Used hands-on mechanical assembly to fabricate prototype which detected less than 25 ppm of ammonia with reduced physical scale
* Automated data processing through MATLAB code allowing user-friendly and calibration-free concentration measurement
### Wind Tunnel Particle Detection
* Designed and optimized an optical detection system for 50-micron sized metal particle detection in wind tunnel flow
* Conducted FEA and collision simulation in SOLIDWORKS to assess wind tunnel safety and component durability
* Collaborated with researchers to implemented 532 nm laser, spectrometer, and camera for excitation and detection of particles
* Delivered results and recommendation to the sponsoring organization on schedule, supported by detailed reports and analyses
### Senior Design Project
* Member in designing, prototyping, and building a drone to be launched in a rocket and return home with a payload
* Completed part design with FEA analysis and managed 3D printing of drone parts
* Demonstrated project to sponsors, answered questions, and secured funding
* View [Senior Design Project](https://camden-carroll.github.io/portfolio/1-seniordesign)
### Aerospace Design
* Coursework in aircraft design characteristics and performance calculations
* Graduate level coursework in highspeed and Mach flow calculations
* Simulated flow characteristics and equations with MATLAB
### Analysis of Experiments
* Conducted experiment to determine treatment effects of 3D printed specimens
* Researched relevant ASTM standards and used factorial experiment designs
* Interpreted data with ANOVA methods and presented results to instructor

PORFESSIONAL EXPIRIENCE
=====
### Graduate Research Assistant (University of Tennessee, Knoxville, 2023-24)
* Performed inter-disciplinary research through design, fabrication, modification, analysis, and documentation of mechanical systems
* Applied CAD, including SOLIDWORKS, to develop detailed part and assembly models, and used FEA for structural analysis
* Presented technical findings through written documentation and oral presentations to peers, project sponsors, and leadership
* Completed projects on schedule while both leading, mentoring new employees, and supporting multiple on-going efforts


### Treatment Plant Intern (Trinity River Authority, 2022)
* Improved inventory retrieval time by 20% through integration and optimization of inventory using IBM Maximo
* Implemented automated maintenance scheduling, improving equipment utilization and operational efficiency
* Developed organizational strategies to prioritize and manage critical components for repetitive repairs
* Delivered results under a compressed timeline, demonstrating effective prioritization and problem-solving abilities 

### Student Worker (LeTourneau University, 2019 – 2022)
* Led team in maintaining fields, directing competitions, and handling conflict during matches
* Used cross-functional teamwork with other school departments and organizations to produce new events for LeTourneau
