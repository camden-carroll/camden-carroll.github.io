Why: <br/>
A part on my dad's grill broke. It was very uncommon and expensive to get for being a piece of plastic.<br/><br/>
How: <br/>
So I replicated the part in SolidWorks and printed with near maximum infill:

Results:<br/>
It is still working to this day.

It was printed with PLA, which doesn't stay strong for very long under sun and humid conditions, so a re-print with better materials may be coming in the future.
