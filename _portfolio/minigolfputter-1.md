During quarentine lock down at college, I wanted to play mini golf in my room. On Hand I had my 3D printer and the lower half of a two-piece fishing rod that was the perfect lenght for a handle. My first step was to design the putter head in SolidWorks and make sure it fit with the tip of the rod.

Once I had a putter head with the right shape, I took some sand from the volley ball courts and added it just before the printer started the top few layres, sealing it in. The final prodect felt pretty heavy.

The final prodkect workd pretty well and gave me some great entertainment!
