During quarentine lock down at college, I wanted to play mini golf in my room. On hand I had my 3D printer and the lower half of a two-piece fishing rod that was the perfect length for a handle. My first step was to design the putter head in SolidWorks and make sure it fit with the tip of the rod.

Once I had a putter head with the right shape, I took some sand from the volley ball courts and added it just before the printer started the top few layers, sealing it in. It wasn't as heavey as a metal putter, but it felt good.

The final prodkect workd pretty well and gave me some great entertainment!
